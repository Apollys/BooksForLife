> There is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen â€” to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.
>
> That is at the heart of being a good person, the ultimate gift you can give to others and to yourself.

This, of course, is the skill that *How to Know a Person* aims to teach.

What a truly mind-expanding idea.

Try picking something you believe fundamentally, with the core of your being, and ask yourself: What would it be like to believe the opposite?

If you feel so compelled, it might even be interesting to write a "day in the life" mini-story or an imaginary journal entry as if from the point of view of a person with this opposite belief.

Personal opinion: you can safely stop reading this book after the chapter on *Life Tasks*, especially if you feel you are losing interest. I felt the remainder of the book was just "writing for the sake of writing" (a lot of miscellaneous story-telling) rather than an attempt to communicate something that will be valuable to the reader.
