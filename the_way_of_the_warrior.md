# The Way of the Warrior

By Erwin Raphael McManus

I actually bought this book just because of the title, with no idea what it was about. It turned out to be very different from what I expected â€” and delightfully so, full of interesting and insightful wisdom.

> On that day as I was driving through Los Angeles, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head whispering a thought that had never occurred to me. I share it with you just as I heard it: *The warrior is not ready for battle until they have come to know peace. This is the way of the warrior.* What I heard felt like more than just an insight; it felt like an invitation. And this invitation, as strange as it sounds, was the beginning of this book.

### Sparks

> Our only hope for peace is to win the battle within. Every war against another is a war that never should have been fought. It should have been won long before. It should have been won from within.
>
> To know peace is the way of the warrior.
>
> [1]

<br/>

> While worry will rob our joy, fear will steal our freedom, for what we fear establishes the boundaries of our freedom.
>
> [7]

<br/>

> Peace does not come when you finally have control over your life; peace comes when you no longer need control.
>
> [9]

<br/>

> We struggle with loneliness because we are searching for love rather than giving it.
>
> [11]

When I read this, I was acutely struggling with loneliness, and that hit hard. But true. So very true.

<br/>

> Wisdom understands that it is less important to win a fight or a point than it is to win the person.
>
> Wisdom knows that you should never fight against people; you should fight for them.

<br/>

> Your internal mind-set designs your external world. If you believe the world is full of possibilities, it is. If you believe the world is filled with fascinating people, you will find them. If you believe in love, you will find love. If you believe in hope, you will find hope.
>
> And the reason you will find them is because you will bring them with you.
>
> [91]

<br/>

> Even if it's not your fault, it's still your responsibility.
>
> Though the wounding wasn't your fault, the healing is your responsibility.
>
> Though your past may not be your fault, your future is your responsibility.
>
> Though their choices were not your fault, your choices are your responsibility.
>
> [114]

<br/>

> Bitterness is how your soul lets you know they still have power over you. Hatred traps the poison inside you. Only love and forgiveness allow you the power to move forward.
>
> [114]

<br/>

> Worry consumes your energy without productivity. Worry is a waste of energy.
>
> [138]

<br/>

> There is something mysterious about the way humans are designed. We are designed to be made strong by the strength of others. We find courage in the courage of others. We are energized and inspired through the energy and inspiration of others.
>
> Allow your soul to be nourished by the courage and inspiration of others.
>
> [146]

<br/>

> If you are filled with despair, you fill the world with despair; if you are filled with bitterness, you fill the world with bitterness; if you are filled with fear, you fill the world with fear. Additionally, that's all you'll ever find. No matter where you go, your world is filled with the same energy and intention that fills you.
>
> [151]

<br/>

> The warrior is never overwhelmed by the grandness of the universe but is elevated by it. To know that you are part of the universe is to know that you are connected to something bigger than yourself.
>
> [173]

<br/>

> The warrior never hides their scars. They know their scars are the story of their life.
>
> The one who has no wounds has never fought a battle.
>
> [197]

<br/>

> In victory every warrior looks to be brave and courageous. Yet it is defeat that strips you bare and forces you to see your truest self.
>
> [199]

If you want to know a person's true character, watch how they act not when they win, but when they lose.

<br/>

> One of the great lies that the darkness tells us is that we are alone.
>
> We convince ourselves that no one else has ever been through what we're facing.
>
> When you find yourself drowning in a deep sense of hopelessness, when with every breath you breathe you seem to only be consumed with despair, never forget there is one that not only understands but has stood where you are standing right now.
>
> [216]
