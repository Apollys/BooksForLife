# Stillness Speaks

By Eckhart Tolle

![Cover Image](stillness_speaks__eckhart_tolle.png)

The wisdom of Eckhart Tolle has a unique character of the utmost profundity and abstractness, combined with exceptional preciseness and succinctness of language. His books are powerful, inspiring, calming, meditative, and certainly impossible to be a waste of time.

This book would probably only an hour to read through cover to cover, if you read it straight through. But you'll get far more out of it if you read it slowly, stopping to ponder, reflect, and even practice the ideas he puts forth.

If you want to read just one passage from this book, start with the one from page 68 (about two-thirds of the way down this page). It may be the most striking upheval of "obvious truth" I have ever read.

### Sparks

> Whenever there is some silence around you — listen to it. That means just notice it. Pay attention to it. Listening to silence awakens the dimension of stillness within yourself, because it is only through stillness that you can be aware of silence.
>
> [4]

<br/>

> When you look at a tree or a human being in stillness, who is looking? Something deeper than the person. Consciousness is looking at its creation.
>
> [10]

<br/>

> When you no longer believe everything you think, you step out of thought and see clearly that the thinker is not who you are.
>
> [21]

<br/>

> Feel the energy of your inner body. Immediately mental noise slows down or ceases. Feel it in your hands, your feet, your abdomen, your chest. Feel the life that you are, the life that animates the body.
>
> [25]

<br/>

> A power and intelligence greater than you and yet one with you in essence takes over. There is no decision-making process anymore; spontaneous right action happens, and "you" are not doing it. Mastery of life is the opposite of control. You become aligned with the greater consciousness. *It* acts, speaks, does the works.
>
> [29]

<br/>

> When you recognize that there is a voice in your head that pretends to be you and never stops speaking, you are awakening out of your unconscious indentification with the stream of thinking. When you notice that voice, you realize that who you are is not the voice — the thinker — but the one who is aware of it.
>
> Knowing yourself as the awareness behind the voice is freedom.
>
> [35]

<br/>

> When you live through the ego, you always reduce the present moment to a means to an end. You live for the future, and when you achieve your goals, they don't satisfy you, at least not for long.
>
> [37]

<br/>

> In your dealings with people, can you detect subtle feelings of either superiority or inferiority toward them? You are looking at the ego, which lives through comparison.
>
> [41]

<br/>

> When you make friends with the present moment, you will feel at home no matter where you are. When you don't feel at home in the Now, no matter where you go, you will carry unease with you.
>
> [50]

<br/>

> Most people confuse the Now with *what happens* in the Now, but that's not what it is. The Now is deeper than what happens in it. It is the space in which it happens.
>
> [56]

<br/>

> You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life, but by realizing who you are at the deepest level.
>
> [64]

<br/>

> When you look at a tree, you are aware of the tree. When you have a thought or feeling, you are aware of that thought or feeling. When you have a pleasurable or painful experience, you are aware of that experience.
>
> These seem to be true and obvious statements, yet if you look at them very closely, you will find that in a subtle way their very structure contains a fundamental illusion. Thought and language create an apparent duality and a separate person where there is none.
>
> The truth is: you are not somebody who is aware of the tree, the thought, feeling, or experience. You are the awareness or consciousness in and by which those things appear.
>
> As you go about your life, can you be aware of yourself as the awareness in which the entire content of your life unfolds?
>
> [68]

<br/>

> Perhaps your mind is now creating a story that says, "This is what my life has come to. Life has treated me harshly and unfairly. I don't deserve this.
>
> Can you accept the *isness* [*is*-ness] of this moment and not confuse it with a story the mind has created around it?
>
> Surrender comes when you no longer ask, "Why is this happening to me?"
>
> [85]

<br/>

> Whatever you accept completely will take you to peace, including the acceptance that you cannot accept, that you are in resistance.
>
> [89]

<br/>

> See how every animal and plant is completely itself. Unlike humans, they have not split themselves in two. They do not live through mental images of themselves, so they do not need to be concerned with trying to protect and enhance those images. The deer *is* itself. The daffodil *is* itself.
>
> [95]

<br/>

> As long as the ego runs your life, most of your thoughts, emotions, and actions arise from desire and fear. In relationships you then either want or fear something from the other person.
>
> When you  make the present moment the focal point of your attention — instead of using it as a means to an end — you go beyond the ego and beyond the unconscious compulsion to use people as a means to an end. Attention, which is alert stillness, is the key.
>
> How wonderful to go beyond wanting and fearing in your relationships. Love does not want or fear anything.
>
> [111]

<br/>

> There is still a widespread denial of death in Western cultures. A culture that denies death inevitably becomes shallow and superficial, concerned only with the external form of things. When death is denied, life loses its depth.
>
> [130]

<br/>

> Much suffering, much unhappiness arises when you take each thought that comes into your head for the truth. Situations don't make you unhappy. They may cause you physical pain, but they don't make you unhappy. Your thoughts make you unhappy. Your interpretations, the stories you tell yourself make you unhappy.
>
> "The thoughts I am thinking right now are making me unhappy." This realization breaks your unconscious identification with those thoughts.
>
> [147]

<br/>

> Is suffering really necessary? Yes and no.
>
> If you had not suffered as you have, there would be no depth to you as a human being, no humility, no compassion. You would not be reading this now. Suffering cracks open the shell of ego, and then comes a point when it has served its purpose.
>
> Suffering is necessary until you realize it is unnecessary.
>
> [145]
