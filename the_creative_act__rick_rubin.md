# The Creative Act: A Way of Being

By Rick Rubin

![Cover Image](the_creative_act__rick_rubin.png)

Ostensibly a book about art, this may be one of the most wonderful guides to life I have ever read.

In this book, Rick Rubin quotes the following:

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

I have never seen a book that more magnificently embodies this philosophy than The Creative Act, nor one that even comes close. I am confident you could open this book to any page at random and find something on that page that is both intriguing and valuable.

The task of passage selection has never been more challenging...

### Sparks

> What you make doesn't have to be witnessed, recorded, sold, or encased in glass for it to be a work of art. Through the ordinary state of being, we're already creators in the most profound way, creating our experience of reality and composing the world we perceive.
>
> [2]

<br/>

> How do we pick up on a signal that can neither be heard nor be defined? The answer is not to look for it. Instead, we create an open space that allows it. A space so free of the normal overpacked condition of our minds that it functions as a vacuum. Drawing down the ideas that the universe is making available.
>
> [8]

<br/>

> The act of creation is an attempt to enter a mysterious realm. A longing to transcend. What we create allows us to share glimpses of an inner landscape, one that is beyong our understanding. Art is our portal to the unseen world.
>
> [31]

<br/>

> Look for what you notice but no one else sees.
>
> [42]

<br/>

> We tend to think of the artist's work as the output.
>
> The real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.
>
> [48]

<br/>

> Because there's an endless amount of data available to us and we have a limited bandwidth to conserve, we might consider carefully curating the quality of what we allow in.
>
> [50]

<br/>

> Nature transcends our tendencies to label and classify, to reduce and limit. The natural world is unfathomably more rich, interwoven, and complicated than we are taught, and so much more mysterious and beautiful.
>
> [52]

<br/>

> To the best of my ability, I've followed my intuition to make career turns, and been recommended against doing so every time. It helps to realize that it's better to follow the universe than those around you.
>
> [70]

<br/>

> It's helpful to see the piece we're working on as an experiment. Whatever the result, we will receive useful information that will benefit the next experiment.
>
> [78]

<br/>

> Nothing begins with us.
>
> The more we pay attention, the more we begin to realize that all the work we even do is a collaboration.
>
> It's a collaboration with the art that's come before you and the art that will come after. It's also a collaboration with the world you're living in.
>
> [89]

<br/>

> Rules direct us to average behaviors. If we're aiming to create works that are exceptional, most rules don't apply. Average is nothing to aspire to.
>
> Art is confrontation. It widens the audience's reality, allowing them to glimpse life through a different window.
>
> [98]

<br/>

> Every innovation risks becoming a rule. And innovcation risks becoming an end in itself.
>
> When we make a discovery that serves our work, it's not unusual to concretize this into a formula. On occasion, we decide this formula is who we are as an artist.
>
> It's helpful to continually challenge your own process.
>
> [101]

<br/>

> Be aware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it's the way you've done it before.
>
> [105]

<br/>

> Formulating an opinion is not listening. Neither is preparing a response, or defending our position or attacking another's. To listen impatiently is to hear nothing at all.
>
> Listening is suspending disbelief.
>
> [111]

<br/>

> Consider how different your experience of the world might be if you engaged in every activity with the attention you might give to landing a plane.
>
> [114]

<br/>

> These childlike superpowers include being in the moment, valuing play above all else, having no regard for consequences, being radically honest without consideration, and having the ability to freely move from one emotion to the next without holding on to story. For children, each moment in time is all there is.
>
> [122]

<br/>

> For the lungs to draw in air, they must first be emptied.
>
> For the mind to draw inspiration, it wants space to welcome the new.
>
> [128]

<br/>

> Discipline and freedom seem like opposites. In reality, they are partners. Discipline is not a lack of freedom, it is a harmonious relationship with time. Managing your schedule and daily habits well is a necessary component to free up the practical and creative capacity to make great art.
>
> [135]

(I must here mention the wonderful book *Discipline Equals Freedom* by Jocko Willink.)

<br/>

> We want to set up an environment where the decision making occurs free of the misguiding force of persuasion. Persuasion leads to mediocrity. To be evaluated, ideas have to be seen, heard, tasted, or touched.
>
> [159]

<br/>

> Work as far forward as you can while crafting and then step away without repetitively consuming the unfinished work. By not accepting the work-in-progress as the standard version, we leave room for growth, change, and development to continue.
>
> [172]

<br/>

> When you're on a roll in the Craft phase, work toward a full first draft. Maintain the momentum. If you reach a section of the work that gives you trouble, instead of letting this blockage stop you, work around it. Although your instinct may be to create sequentially, bypass the section where you're stuck, complete the other parts, then come back to it.
>
> If you're holding a center puzzle piece in your hand and staring at an empty tabletop, it's difficult to determine where to place it. If all of the puzzle is complete except for that one piece, then you know exactly where it goes.
>
> [173]

<br/>

> When we hear something new, it provides insight into where we've been and where else we could go. We may have thought we could only move forward. But when someone turns left, it shows we can also go right.
>
> [182]

<br/>

> If we live in a mindset of scarcity, we hoard great ideas. A comedian may be presented with a perfect opportunity to tell a favorite new joke they've written, but instead will hold it back waiting for a more high-profile occasion. When we use our material, new content comes through. And the more we share, the more our skills improve.
>
> [201]

<br/>

> How shall we measure success?
>
> It isn't popularity, money, or critical success. Success occurs in the privacy of the soul. It comes in the moment you decide to release the work, before exposure to a single opinion. When you've done all you can to bring out the work's greatest potential.
>
> Success has nothing to do with variables outside yourself.
>
> Popular success is a poor barometer of work and worth. In order for a work to connect commercially, stars must align and none of them relate to how good the project is. It might be the timing, the distribution mechanism, the mood of the culture, or a connection to current events.
>
> Most variables are completely out of our control. The only ones we can control are doing our best work, sharing it, starting the next, and not looking back.
>
> [219]
