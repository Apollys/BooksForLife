# The Library of Life: Literary Gems

A selection of the most insightful books I've read, covering a wide variety of topics.

My intention here is to include just enough sparks of insight from each book to ignite a fire of curiosity and the drive to learn more in your mind. I aim not to fully cover the content of the books, but rather to provide you with the information to decide and prioritize which of these books are worth the time for you to discover firsthand.

Cheap simplifications and summaries of summaries of great works are an unfortunately infectious phenomenon of the modern "Age of Information Inundation". If you find something in here snags your attention, I encourage you to dive deeply into it. Plunging deeply into one thing brings more value than dipping your toes into the waters of a thousand things.

Be not provoked nor bothered by the *Fear Of Missing Out*. The only one who misses out is the one who is too busy trying to do everything else that they have no attention left for what they're doing right now. If you are completely attendant to what you're doing now, you are never missing out, for this is the fullest experience of life.

The purpose of this list is to allow you to prioritize and take the time to discover and think deeply about these things yourself. Please do not feel obligated or even motivated to read *the whole list* just for the sake of it.
