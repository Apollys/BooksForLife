# The World's Religions

By Huston Smith

![Cover Image](images/the_worlds_religions.png)

An introductory tour of Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.

This book is a wonderful way to see patterns across different religions and people. For example, Buddha and Jesus were strikingly similar in character, values, and the context of their enlightenments.

At the same time, I must be honest: I learned a variety of interesting things from this book, but I learned much less about the world's religions than I would have expected from a book titled "The World's Religions." I still have almost no idea what the religious teachings of either Judaism or Islam are, even after reading their respective chapters twice each.

In many places, the author spends a lot of time talking about the stories and histories of people, and relatively little time discussing the actual religion itself. Don't expect to come out of this book being highly knowledgeable about the world's religions, but perhaps your interest will have been piqued sufficiently about a particular religion to go pick up a book dedicated specifically to that religion.

### Sparks

#### Hinduism

> The reason one eventually comes to this discovery [that pleasure is not all that one wants] is not because pleasure is wicked, but because it is too trivial to satisfy one's total nature. Pleasure is essentially private, and the self is too small an object for perpetual enthusiasm.
>
> Soren Kierkegaard tried for a while what he called the aesthetic life, which made enjoyment its guiding principle, only to experience its radical failure, which he described in *Sickness Unto Death*. "The glamour of yesterday I have come to see as tinsel."
>
> [14]

These words immediately conjure to mind the ideas in [Dopamine Nation](dopamine_nation.md).

<br/>

> Wealth, fame, and power are exclusive, hence competitive, hence precarious. Unlike mental and spiritual values, they do not multiply when shared; they cannot be distributed without diminishing one's own portion.
>
> [15]

<br/>

> The guiding principle is not to turn from desire until desire turns from you, for Hinduism regards the objects of the Path of Desire as if they were toys. If we ask ourselves whether there is anything wrong with toys, our answer must be: On the contrary, the thought of children without them is sad. Even sadder, however, is the prospect of adults who fail to develop interests more significant than dolls and trains.
>
> [17]

<br/>

> How could one feel disappointed at one's own defeat if one experienced the victor's joy as also one's own?
>
> [23]

<br/>

> Everything I do for my private wellbeing adds another layer to my ego, and in thickening it insulates me more from God. Conversely, every act done without thought for myself diminishes my self-centeredness until finally no barrier remains to separate me from the Divine.
>
> [38]

<br/>

> *Karma yogis* will try to do each thing as it comes as if it were the only thing to be done and, having done it, turn to the next duty in similar spirit.
>
> [40]

<br/>

> Differences in human nature call for a variety of paths toward life's fulfillment.
>
> Not only do individuals differ from one another; each individual moves through different stages, each of which calls for its own appropriate conduct.
>
> [50]

<br/>

> All dreams of utopia are not just doomed to disappointment; they misjudge the world's purpose, which is not to rival paradise but to provide a training ground for the human spirit. The world is the soul's gymnasium, its school and training field. What we do is important, but ultimately, it is important for the discipline it offers our individual character.
>
> [65]

<br/>

#### Buddhism

> [About the Buddha...]
>
> Each year was likewise divided: nine months in the world, followed by a three-month retreat with his monks during the rainy season. His daily cycle, too, was patterned to this mold. His public hours were long, but three times a day he withdrew, to return his attention (through meditation) to its sacred source.
>
> [87]

<br/>

> Buddha preached a religion devoid of authority.
>
> [94]

> Buddha preached a religion that skirted [avoided] speculation.
>
> [95]

<br/>

> [Characteristics of Buddhism:]
>
> 1. It was empirical.
> 2. It was scientific.
> 3. It was pragmatic.
> 4. It was therapeutic.
> 5. It was psychological.
> 6. It was egalitarian.
> 7. It was directed to individuals.
>
> [98]

<br/>

> Even pleasure is gilded pain.
>
> "That unrest which men miscall delight."
>
> [100]

<br/>

> When a wild elephant is to be tamed and trained, the best way to begin is by yoking it to one that has already been through the process. By contact, the wild one comes to see that the condition it is being led toward is not wholly incompatible with being an elephant — that what is expected of it does not contradict its nature categorically and heralds a condition that, though startlingly different, is viable.
>
> [105]

<br/>

> Fearful and disgusting sights are to be meditated on until one no longer experiences aversion toward them. The entire world should be pervaded with thoughts of loving-kindness.
>
> [110]

<br/>

#### Zen Buddhism

> Zen masters may order their disciples to rip their scriptures to shreds and avoid words like Buddha or *nirvana* as if they were smut. They intend no disrespect. What they are doing is straining by every means they can think of to blast their novices out of solutions that are only verbal.
>
> [131]

Do you ever feel yourself giving solutions that are only verbal? You can speak the answer, but you don't really *feel* it within yourself. Maybe this means it isn't an answer after all.

<br/>

> Do not seek after truth. Merely cease to hold opinions.
>
> [139]

<br/>

#### Confucianism

> [Of Confucius...]
>
> Power and wealth could have been his for the asking if he had been willing to compromise with those in authority. He preferred, instead, his integrity.
>
> "With coarse food to eat, water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow, I still have joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness mean no more to me than the floating clouds."
>
> [158]

<br/>

> [Various maxims of Confucius:]
>
> I will not grieve that others do not know me. I will grieve that I do not know others.
>
> Do not wish for quick results, nor look for small advantages. If you seek quick results, you will not attain the ultimate goal. If you are led astray by small advantages, you will never accomplish great things.
>
> When you see someone of worth, think of how you may emulate. When you see someone unworthy, examine your own character.
>
> [159]

<br/>

> If there is righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character.
>
> If there is beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home.
>
> If there is harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation.
>
> If there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.
>
> [174]

<br/>

#### Taoism (Daoism)

> Better renderings [of *wu wei*] are *pure effectiveness* and *creative quietude*.
>
> Creative quietude combines within a single individual two seemingly incompatible conditions — supreme activity and supreme relaxation.
>
> [207]

<br/>

> Viewed externally, *wu wei* — never forcing, never under strain — seems quite effortless. The secret here lies in the way it seeks out the empty spaces in life and nature and moves through these.
>
> [209]

<br/>

> A leader is best when people barely know that he exists. Of a good leader, who talks little, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say, "We did this ourselves."
>
> [210]

<br/>

> "He who feels punctured must once have been a bubble."
>
> [217]

<br/>

#### Judaism

> From a very early date, possibly from the very beginning of the biblical record, the Jews were monotheists.
>
> The significance of this achievement in religious thought lies ultimately in the focus it introduces into life. If God is that to which one gives oneself unreservedly, to have more than one God is to live a life of divided loyalties.
>
> [274]

<br/>

> [Quoting T.S. Eliot's' *The Cocktail Party*]
>
> I must tell you that I should really like to think there's something wrong with me. Because if there isn't, then there's something wrong with the world itself — and that's much more frightening! That would be terrible. So I'd rather believe there is something wrong with me that could be put right.
>
> [277]

<br/>

#### Christianity

> Fasting and solitude were means for [contacting the Spirit], and Jews who felt the call would periodically remove themselves from the world's distractions to commune with the divine through these aids.
>
> [320]

<br/>

> Having descended, the Spirit "drove" Jesus into the wilderness where, during forty days of prayer and fasting, he consolidated the Spirit that had entered him. Having done so, he reentered the world, empowered.
>
> [320]

A remarkably similar story to that of the Buddha's enlightenment, fasting and meditating under a tree.

<br/>

> [Peter's summary of what Jesus did during his lifetime:]
>
> "He went about doing good."
>
> [324]

<br/>

> Above all [Jesus] hated hypocrisy, because it hid people from themselves and precluded the authenticity he sought to build into relationships.
>
> In the end it seemed to those who knew him best that here was a man in whom the human ego had disappeared, leaving his life so completely under the will of God that it was transparent to that will.
>
> [328]

<br/>

> Life for them was no longer a matter of coping. It was glory discerned.
>
> What produced this love and joy in these early Christians? Three intolerable burdens had suddenly and dramatically been lifted from their shoulders.
>
> The first of these was fear, including the fear of death.
>
> The second burden from which they had been released was guilt.
>
> The third release the Christians experienced was from the cramping confines of the ego.
>
> [333]

<br/>

#### The Primal Religions

> Chief among the endowments that exclusive reliance on speech confers is human memory. Literate peoples grow slack in recall.
>
> [369]

<br/>

> Because writing has no limits, it can proliferate to the point where people get lost in its endless corridors. Secondary material comes to blur what is important. Minds become waterlogged with information and narrowed through specialization.
>
> [370]

This book was written in the 1950s, but it feels so pointedly relevant, as if it were written for today...
