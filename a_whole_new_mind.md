# A Whole New Mind

By Daniel H. Pink

![Cover Image](a_whole_new_mind.png)

> The last few decades have belonged to a certain kind of person with a certain kind of mind — computer programmers who could crank code, lawyers who could craft contracts, MBAs who could crunch numbers. But the keys to the kingdom are changing hands. The future belongs to a very different kind of person with a very different kind of mind — creators and empathizers, pattern recognizers, and meaning makers.
>
> We are moving from an economy and a society build on the logical, linear, computerlike capabilities of the Information Age to an economy and a society built on the inventive, empathic, big-picture capabilities of what's rising in its place, the Conceptual Age. *A Whole New Mind* is for anyone who wants to survive and thrive in this world.
>
> In this book, you will learn the six essential aptitudes on which professional success and personal satisfaction increasingly will depend. Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning.

### Sparks

> Within organizations, the most effective leaders were funny. These leaders had their charges laughing three times more often than their managerial counterparts.
>
> [58]

<br/>

> In the conceptual age, we will need to complement our L-Directed [left-brain] reasoning by mastering six essential R-Directed [right-brain] aptitudes.
>
> Not just function but also **Design**.
>
> Not just argument but also **Story**.
>
> Not just focus but also **Symphony**.
>
> Not just logic but also **Empathy**.
>
> Not just seriousness but also **Play**.
>
> Not just accumulation but also **Meaning**.
>
> [65]

<br/>

#### Design

> "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives.
>
> [69]

<br/>

> The school marries design to math, science, English, social studies, and other subjects. For example, when they study the Roman Empire, rather than only read about the Roman water delivery process, the students build a model aqueduct.
>
> "They're learning to bring disparate things together to a solution. That's what designers do."
>
> [72]

<br/>

> [On the 2000 U.S. presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush...]
>
> The nonpartisan investigation found that what decided the outcome in Palm Beach Country — and therefore determined who would become leader of the free world — wasn't an evil Supreme Court or recalcitrant chads. *It was bad design.* The bewildering butterfly ballot confused thousands of voters and cost Gore the presidency.
>
> [85]

<br/>

> Buy a small notebook and begin carrying it with you wherever you go [or use a notes app on your phone]. When you see great design make a note of it. Do the same for flawed design.
>
> Before long, you'll be looking at graphics, interiors, environments, and much more with greater acuity. And you'll understand in a deeper way how design decisions shape our everyday lives.
>
> [89]

<br/>

> Never say "I could have done that" because you didn't.
>
> [92]

<br/>

#### Story

> "Humans are not ideally set up to understand logic; they are ideally set up to understand stories."
>
> [102]

<br/>

> "Stories — that's how people make sense of what's happening to them when they get sick. They tell stories about themselves. Our ability as doctors to treat and heal is bound up in our ability to accurately perceive a patient's story. If you can't do that, you're working with one hand tied behind your back."
>
> [112]

<br/>

#### Symphony

> "What I do is pattern recognition. I try to recognize the pattern before anyone else does."
>
> [153]

<br/>

> "Creativity generally involves crossing the boundaries of domains."
>
> The most creative among us see relationships the rest of us never notice.
>
> [153]

<br/>

> Self-made millionaires are four times more likely than the rest of the population to be dyslexic.
>
> "Dyslexics think differently. They are intuitive and excel at problem-solving, seeing the big picture, and simplifying... They are poor rote reciters, but inspired visionaries."
>
> [141]

<br/>

> To brainstorm properly, abide by these rules:
>
> 1. Go for Quantity.
> 2. Encourage Wild Ideas.
> 3. Be Visual.
> 4. Defer Judgment.
>
> [156]

<br/>

#### Empathy

> Ekman journeyed to the highlands of New Guinea and showed the same set of facial expression photos to tribespeople who'd never seen television, or even a Westerner, before. They read the faces the same way all of Ekman's previous subjects did.
>
> Facial expressions were universal.
>
> [162]

<br/>

> The doctor's empathic listening, intuition, and willingness to deviate from the rules meant the difference between life and death. "I just listened to my patient. He said 'I know my body and something's just not right.'" Empathy saved [the patient's] life.
>
> [169]

<br/>

> The differences in the two thinking styles, as Baron-Cohen describes them, are intriguing.
>
> "Systematizing involves exactness, excellent attention to local detail," and an attraction to fixed rules independent of context. "To systematize, you need detachment."
>
> Empathy "involves inexactness, attention to the larger picture, context, with no expectation of lawfulness (what made her happy yesterday may not make her happy tomorrow)."
>
> [173]

<br/>

> *Mind in the Eyes Test*
>
> This one measures your ability to identify a facial expression from only a person's eyes.

The book provides a link which is broken, but I found it [here](https://embrace-autism.com/reading-the-mind-in-the-eyes-test/).

I took this test and scored exactly on the autistic average (25 correct answers, 10 minutes). However, the neurotypical average is only 2 higher (27), and all but one of my wrong answers were me "coin-flipping" between the correct answer and a similar wrong answer (a lot of my wrong answers were even ones I changed away from the correct one).

All that is to say, I'm not sure of the statistical significance of this result, but it was a very fun and useful exercise! I will definitely be paying more attention to the emotions in people's eyes in the future.

<br/>

> *How Did I Get Here?*
>
> Sometimes you work near people for years but have little idea about the path that brought them alongside of you.
>
> [182]

I would apply this even more broadly: Pick anyone you think has accomplished something that you would like to aspire towards, and instead of focusing on what they're doing now, try to learn what they did to get there. What was their *full path* to this achievement?

<br/>

#### Play

> Humor is showing itself to be an accurate marker for managerial effectiveness, emotional intelligence, and the thinking style characteristic of the brain's right hemisphere.
>
> [188]

<br/>

> Humor embodies many of the right hemisphere's most powerful attributes — the ability to place situations in context, to glimpse the big picture, and to combine differing perspectives into new alignments.
>
> [198]

I would add: Fundamentally, humor requires understanding whether the other person will find what you say funny. Humor requires empathy.

<br/>

> "If you're laughing, you cannot think. That is the objective we achieve in meditation."
>
> The meditative mind is the route to joyfulness. Joyfulness differs from happiness. Happiness is conditional, joyfulness is unconditional.
>
> [202]

<br/>

#### Meaning

> Michael Persinger, a neuroscientist at Ontario's Laurentian University, has conducted experiments with a device that's come to be called a "God helmet." Persinger fastens the helmet onto subjects' heads and bathes their brains' right hemispheres in a weak field of electromagnetic radiation. Most of those who have strapped on the apparatus report feeling either the presence of God or a oneness with the universe, suggesting again that spiritual and mystical thoughts and experiences may be part of our neurophysiology.

> [Discussing the things that contribute to happiness...]
>
> Also important are gratitude, forgiveness, and optimism.
>
> What doesn't seem to matter much at all, according to the research, are making more money, getting lots of education, or living in a pleasant climate.
>
> [226]

<br/>

> Gratitude is a key component of personal happiness. People who are grateful about specific things in their past, who dwell on the sweet triumphs instead of the bitter disappointments, tend to be more satisfied about the present.
>
> [236]
